## What is this?
Sumobot is a sport in which two autonomous robots attempt to push each other out of a circle (from wiki). Along with [Tishya](https://github.com/tishyakhanna97) and [Zhe Xuan](https://github.com/Raikonen), we took part in this intra school Sumobot competition and achieved **3rd/4th placing amongst over 40 teams** :thumbsup:. </br>

Here's a picture of our robot! (P.S. that's its championship belt.) </br>
